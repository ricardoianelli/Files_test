# Files_test
Basic file manipulation with C#

Created to train C#, OOP, and basic file manipulation.

1. Create a file called `sales.csv` with the following text:

```
TV LED,1290.99,1
Video Game Chair,350.50,3
Iphone X,900.00,2
Samsung Galaxy 9,850.00,2
```

2. Run the program, insert the full path to the `.csv` file you've created. It will generate a new folder `c:\temp\sales\out` and a file `summary.csv` with products and order total price.
